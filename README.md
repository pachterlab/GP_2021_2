Code to reproduce the figures and results in the preprint ["Analytical solutions of the chemical master equation with bursty production and isomerization reactions"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.24.436847v1) by Gennady Gorin and Lior Pachter. 

``dag_cme_burst.py`` implements the DAG generation, stochastic matrix construction, simulation, and analytical solution routines. 

``gg210110_dag_1.ipynb`` demonstrates the performance of the algorithm in a Jupyter notebook.
