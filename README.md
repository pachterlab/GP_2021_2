# GP_2021_2

Code to reproduce the figures and results in the preprint "Analytical solutions of the chemical master equationwith bursty production and isomerization reactions" by Gennady Gorin and Lior Pachter. 

``dag_cme_burst.py`` implements the DAG generation, stochastic matrix construction, simulation, and analytical solution routines. 

``gg210110_dag_1.ipynb`` demonstrates the performance of the algorithm in a Jupyter notebook.
